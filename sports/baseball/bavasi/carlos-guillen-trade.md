### Key takeaways
- Guillén delivered consistently strong overall value during this window; Seattle cycled through multiple shortstops with more modest results.
- The gap is most obvious in the combined/weighted view (by plate appearances), which emphasizes the everyday contributors each year.
- Context (injuries, roster churn, and ages) matters, but the performance delta remains clear in aggregate.
