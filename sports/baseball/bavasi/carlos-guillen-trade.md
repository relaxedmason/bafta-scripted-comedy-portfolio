### Key takeaways
- Guillén delivered consistently strong overall value during this window; Seattle cycled through multiple shortstops with more modest results.
- The gap is most obvious in the combined/weighted view (by plate appearances), which emphasizes the everyday contributors each year.
- Context (injuries, roster churn, and ages) matters, but the performance delta remains clear in aggregate.

### What this adds
- Puts the trade’s player-for-player outcome in context, separate from Seattle’s broader shortstop carousel.
- Highlights Guillén’s offensive/on-base edge and overall value relative to Santiago’s lighter bat.

## Reading & reproducibility notes

<details>
<summary><strong>Definitions & conventions</strong></summary>

- **Window:** 2004–2007 (primary). Earlier/later seasons may be referenced on the logic page for context.
- **Weighting:** Aggregates are **weighted by plate appearances** where noted to reflect true playing time.
- **Positions:** Mariners figures reflect players **while manning SS** (team-level view). The Guillén/Santiago panel is player-centric.
- **Data sources:** Derived from public leaderboards (e.g., FanGraphs) exported and cleaned; exact filters and transformations are documented on the logic page.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Caveats</strong></summary>

- Team usage patterns (injuries, call-ups, and role splits) can mask individual peaks/valleys.
- Defensive metrics vary by provider and can shift season-to-season; conclusions rely on multi-year patterns rather than single-year spikes.
</details>
