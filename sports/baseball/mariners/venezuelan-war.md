# Seattle’s Legacy of Venezuelan Talent

Baseball has deep roots in Venezuela, producing a remarkable number of elite players who have left their mark on the United State's national past time. From Hall of Famers to modern stars, Venezuelan-born players have consistently delivered impact across every facet of Major League Baseball, cementing the country as one of the league’s most vital international pipelines for talent.

The Seattle Mariners have historically leaned into this connection. They invested early in international scouting and development, even establishing an academy there in 2015 to help identify and nurture young prospects. That pipeline brought in impactful players over the years, strengthening the club’s roster and leaving a lasting mark on the franchise’s identity. While political and logistical challenges have changed how teams operate academies in Venezuela, the Mariners’ legacy of recruiting Venezuelan talent remains an important part of their history.
