## Hi! My name is Mason Colborn

I’m a Pacific Northwest–based data analyst who turns messy, real-world data into clear, decision-ready insights. My sweet spot is the full loop: querying and shaping data (SQL/Python), analyzing patterns, and communicating results with clean visuals and plain-English narratives.

---

## What I do best
- **Operational analytics & forecasting** — repeatable SQL/Python workflows that drive buying, inventory, and promo decisions.
- **Data modeling & maintenance** — healthy enterprise tables (updates, weekly maintenance, temp tables, CTEs).
- **Decision support dashboards & visuals** — getting the right metrics in front of the right people.
- **Storytelling with data** — translating analysis into actions stakeholders actually use.

---

## Selected impact
- Launched a “**Percent of List**” buying program that **saved >$20K per quarter** via selective purchasing.  
- Built weekly analytics + visualizations that **reduced out-of-stocks ~15%** company-wide.  
- Promoted to add category management after contributing to a **25% YoY sales increase** as lead analyst & primary buyer.  
- Forecasted demand for weekly flyers and optimized category resets (e.g., wine) with aggregates and CTEs.

## Tools I reach for
**SQL:** SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL  
**Python:** pandas, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib  
**BI & Viz:** Tableau, Power BI, Excel (VLOOKUP, pivots, conditional formatting)  
**Cloud/Data:** Microsoft Azure (Databricks, Data Lake, Data Warehouse)  
**Also:** R (ggplot2) when needed

## Experience
**Data Analyst — The Markets LLC (WA) • Feb 2022–Mar 2024**  
- Audited algorithmic orders with **T-SQL** across seven stores in Western & Eastern WA.  
- Built **temp-table** workflows to analyze movement and support **real-time purchasing**.  
- Performed **weekly enterprise maintenance** and table updates.  
- Owned **demand forecasts** for weekly flyers; shipped **stakeholder-ready spreadsheets** and visuals.  
- Led **category resets** (e.g., wine) using aggregates and CTEs.
