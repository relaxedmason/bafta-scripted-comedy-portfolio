## Hi, I‚Äôm Mason Colborn

I‚Äôm a Pacific Northwest‚Äìbased data analyst who turns messy, real-world data into clear, decision-ready insights. My sweet spot is the full loop: querying and shaping data (SQL/Python), analyzing patterns, and communicating results with clean visuals and plain-English narratives. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## What I do best

- **Operational analytics & forecasting** ‚Äî build repeatable SQL/Python workflows that drive buying, inventory, and promo decisions.
- **Data modeling & maintenance** ‚Äî keep enterprise tables healthy (updates, weekly maintenance, temp tables, CTEs).
- **Decision support dashboards** ‚Äî put the right metrics in front of the right people (Tableau / Power BI / Excel).
- **Storytelling with data** ‚Äî translate analysis into actions stakeholders actually use.
