# BAFTA Scripted Comedy Awards: Winners & Nominees (2016–2025)

## 1. Business Question  
**Which scripted comedies have dominated the BAFTAs over the last decade?**  
- Did the highest-rated IMDb show win each year?  
- Which series beat *Peep Show*, a seven-time nominee?

---

## 2. Data & Plumbing  

### a) SQL  
Pull the last ten award cycles of nominees vs winners, enriched with IMDb metadata:

```sql
WITH last10 AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT awardyear
  FROM bafta_comedy_awards
  WHERE awardtitle = 'Best Scripted Comedy'
    AND bafta_status = 'winner'
  ORDER BY awardyear DESC
  OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY
),
nominees AS (
  SELECT
    b.awardyear,
    b.bafta_status,
    b.tconst
  FROM bafta_comedy_awards b
  JOIN last10 l ON b.awardyear = l.awardyear
  WHERE b.awardtitle = 'Best Scripted Comedy'
> **Full SQL** → [last_10_Bafta_scripted_comedy_winner.sql](scripts/last_10_Bafta_scripted_comedy_winner.sql)
