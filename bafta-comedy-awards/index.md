# BAFTA Scripted Comedy Data Projects

As a lifelong fan of British TV comedy, I set out to analyze the nominees and winners of the BAFTA TV Awards for Best Scripted Comedy. My aim was threefold:

1. Unearth under-the-radar gems I’d missed as an American viewer  
2. Track how *Peep Show*—my favorite and a seven-time nominee—stacked up  
3. Flag any nominees whose IMDb ratings suggest they deserved the trophy instead

To power this analysis, I built my own IMDb database from their non-commercial datasets, enriched it with show details scraped from Wikipedia, and fetched poster assets via the TMDb API. Finally, I brought it all together in a striking poster-style visualization generated in Python.
